            <h2>What are "colors" of noise?</h2>
            <p>
                Think of noise as sound made up of different frequencies. Colors of noise are simply different types of noise, each with a different frequency makeup. Just like colors in the visible light spectrum, each type of noise has its own unique characteristics.

            <p>
                The main colors of noise are typically categorized into five types, each representing a different distribution of frequencies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>White Noise</li>
                <li>Pink Noise</li>
                <li>Brown Noise</li>
                <li>Blue Noise</li>
                <li>Violet Noise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These colors of noise are named based on their analogy to the colors of light in the visible spectrum, with white noise representing an equal distribution of all frequencies, and the other colors representing specific frequency distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like how different colors evoke different feelings or moods, different types of noise can have different effects on our perception and concentration.

                    White noise is a type of sound that contains every frequency humans can hear, all at the same time, like a big jumble of sound. It's called "white" noise because it's like white light, which contains all the colors of the rainbow mixed together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you hear white noise, it can be soothing because it masks other sounds that might disturb you, like traffic or people talking

                <h2>Pink Noise</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-noise">

                <p>
                    Pink noise is another type of noise, sligthly different from white noise.
                    While white noise contains equal power across all frequencies within the audible range, pink noise has more power in lower frequencies, with power decreasing as the frequency increases. This means that as you move up the frequency spectrum, each octave of pink noise contains less power than the previous one. Consequently, pink noise sounds deeper and fuller than white noise, with a softer and more balanced quality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While white noise can be likened to the sound of static or the hiss of a television, pink noise resembles the soothing rush of a waterfall or the rustling of leaves in a gentle breeze.

            <div class="article-heading">
                <h2>Brown Noise</h2>

            <p>
                Brown noise is another variant of noise, distinct from both white and pink noise. Unlike white noise, which distributes power equally across all audible frequencies, and pink noise, which exhibits a decrease in power as frequency increases, brown noise showcases a more pronounced drop-off in power as frequency rises. This results in a sound profile where lower frequencies dominate, gradually tapering off in intensity towards higher frequencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                While pink noise conjures images of gentle cascades or the whispering of foliage, brown noise envelops listeners in a more immersive and immersive experience, evoking the steady flow of a river, or the comforting rumble of distant thunder.

                <h2>Gray Noise</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-noise">
                <aside class="noise-image">
                    <img src="./resources/images/noise-color-spectrograms/gray_noise_spectrum.png" alt="Spectrogram of gray noise">

            </div>
            <p>
                Gray noise, much like its counterparts, is a form of random noise with a unique spectral profile. Gray noise, however, differs in its distribution of power across frequencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to white noise, which evenly distributes power across all audible frequencies, gray noise adjusts its power distribution to compensate for the way human ears perceive sound.<br>
                Gray noise accounts for this sensitivity by increasing the power of frequencies within the mid-range while gradually decreasing power at higher and lower frequencies. This adjustment results in a sound profile that appears more balanced to human perception, neither dominated by high frequencies nor overwhelmed by low frequencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gray noise offers a more neutral auditory experience. It can sound like a bustling city street or the hum of machinery in the background. It is present, but not intrusive, providing a subtle masking effect without overwhelming the listener.

        <section class="blue-niose">
            <div class="article-heading">
                <h2>Blue Noise</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-noise">
                <aside class="noise-image">
                    <img src="./resources/images/noise-color-spectrograms/blue_noise_spectrum.png" alt="Spectrogram of blue noise">
                </aside>
            </div>
            <p>
                Unlike pink and brown noise, where low frequencies have more power, blue noise exhibits greater power at higher frequencies, with power decreasing as the frequency decreases. This results in a sound that is crisp and sharp, often described as resembling the sound of crashing waves or the crackling of leaves underfoot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blue noise can be invigorating and can easily catch your attention, making it useful for enhancing focus and concentration for some people.

            <div class="article-heading">
                <h2>Purple Noise</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about-the-noise">
                <aside class="noise-image">

                </aside>
            </div>
            <p>
                Just as blue noise, purple noise exhibits its greatest power at even higher frequencies, with power gradually decreasing as frequency decreases further.
                It often produces a sound reminiscent of a rush of wind passing through a narrow gap, almost like a whistle.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I find this noise somewhat intrusive, it can serve as a powerful tool for masking distractions and fostering deep focus for some people.
