            <h2>What are "colors" of noise?</h2>
            <p>
                Think of noise as sound made up of different frequencies. Colors of noise are simply different types of noise, each with a different frequency makeup. Just like colors in the visible light spectrum, each type of noise has its own unique characteristics.

            <p>
                The main colors of noise are typically categorized into five types, each representing a different distribution of frequencies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>White Noise</li>
                <li>Pink Noise</li>
                <li>Brown Noise</li>
                <li>Blue Noise</li>
                <li>Violet Noise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These colors of noise are named based on their analogy to the colors of light in the visible spectrum, with white noise representing an equal distribution of all frequencies, and the other colors representing specific frequency distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like how different colors evoke different feelings or moods, different types of noise can have different effects on our perception and concentration.
